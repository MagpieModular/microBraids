/*
  Using timeouts for user interaction
  
  A more "real" example than blinking a LED - demonstrate waiting for user input while 
  flashing a LED in an arbitrary sequence.
 
  This example code is in the public domain.

  The elapsedMillis() and elapsedMicros() code was originally developed for
  the Teensy USB development board (http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/)

  More examples can be found at http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_timing.html

  Note that elapsedMillis variables should usually have global scope.  If they're 
  local, they restart from zero every time the function runs, which might be useful 
  in some cases, but usually you want them to retain their value over longer time.

#include <elapsedMillis.h>
#include <ctype.h>

#define LEDPIN	        13  // The usual Arduino LED port...
#define USERWAITTIME  6000  // milliseconds
#define LEDWAITTIME     35  // milliseconds

// Many non-trivial Arduino programs benefit from being expressed as a state machine.
// This one encodes the various nuances of accepting user input while still doing
// background work (flashing the LED...)
//
// State machine:  a device that can be in one of a set number of stable conditions 
//                 depending on its previous condition and on the present values of 
//                 its inputs.
